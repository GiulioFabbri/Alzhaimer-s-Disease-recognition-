The goal of this project is to build a **model to identify signs of Alzheimer's disease** in brain scans of patients,   
developing also a way of **explain** to doctors which parts of the scan are most relevant to the decision.
  
I structured it as a **3-part tutorial** for those who would like to replicate it:  

1. Using **two balance approach**: Sick vs nonSick and Data augmentation (SMOOTE)
2. Testing various **CNN models** (ex. ResNet,VGG16, MobileNet...)
3. **GradCAM interpretation** to show doctors which parts of the brain are most interesting in determining the presence of the disease
